Categories allow you to organize your prompts hierarchically for better project management.

## Creating a Category

1. In the **Prompts** section, click the **New Category** button.
2. Give your category a name.
3. (Optional) Select a parent category to create a subcategory.

## Hierarchical Categories

You can create nested category structures:

```
Marketing
  ├─ Emails
  ├─ Social Media
  └─ Blog
Customer Support
  ├─ Automated Responses
  └─ Escalation
```

This organization makes navigation easier in large prompt libraries.

## Assigning a Prompt to a Category

When creating or editing a prompt, you can:
- Select an existing category from the dropdown menu
- Create a new category on the fly
- Leave the prompt uncategorized

## Filtering by Category

In the prompts list, use the category filter to display only prompts from a specific category.
